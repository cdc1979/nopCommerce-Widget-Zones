# nopCommerce Widget Zones

This is a full list of widget zones available in nopCommerce.  This is a JSON file so you can use it in your plugins etc.  I have also inclued a field that indicates if the widget zone was added in that particular version (it starts currently at version 3.4).

There is a .cs file for you to copy and paste straight into your code if you need a list of widget zones

Here is an online browser using datatables for all the widget zones.
